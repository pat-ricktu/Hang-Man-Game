# Hang-Man-Game

This is a hangman game that I created in high school using python. Python is a programming language that was friendly to a beginner, which allowed me to learn the syntax of a programming language. In this project, I self-taught myself the language and created a game to demonstrate my knowledge. I also learned C, including arduino, in my introductory programming class in university. While I still have a lot to learn, I enjoy learning the syntax of a new language and applying into a project. Additionally, I enjoy programming because I have to look at the problem and problem solve to find the best solution. In comparison to math and physics, there are endless possibilities to answer any programming question. However, learning how to code efficiently and creating a good program is a challenge that I am willing to take, which is evident in this project.
